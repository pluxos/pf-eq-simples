# Exercise Name

This is an Haskell github classroom autograding template.

Describe the problem here.

Describe expected function definitions

* Define function `hello` which takes 0 parameters and returns string `Hello, Haskell!`.
 
## Hints

A file `Impl.hs` is already defined.
It has a function with the specified signature.
Testing the function errors out, as you can test locally by running [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) or [stack test]() or [cabal]().

Once you have fixed the code, commit and push to the repository created when you accepted the assignment.

## Getting Started

Please refer to the [installation](https://exercism.io/tracks/haskell/installation)
and [learning](https://exercism.io/tracks/haskell/learning) help pages.

## Running the tests

To run the test suite, execute the following command:

```bash
stack test
```

#### If you get an error message like this...

```
No .cabal file found in directory
```

You are probably running an old stack version and need
to upgrade it.

#### Otherwise, if you get an error message like this...

```
No compiler found, expected minor version match with...
Try running "stack setup" to install the correct GHC...
```

Just do as it says and it will download and install
the correct compiler version:

```bash
stack setup
```

## Running *GHCi*

If you want to play with your solution in GHCi, just run the command:

```bash
stack ghci
```
